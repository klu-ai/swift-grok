I’ll walk you through creating a script that automatically grabs cookie name-value pairs from a browser, selecting Python as the scripting language due to its simplicity, cross-platform support, and robust libraries for this task. The script will extract cookies for a specific domain (e.g., `.grok.com`) from popular browsers like Chrome and Firefox, and output them in a format you can easily use elsewhere, such as in a Swift project. Below is a detailed explanation and the complete script.

### Why Python?
I chose Python because:
- **Cross-Platform**: It works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Ease of Use**: Python is straightforward to write and run.
- **Library Support**: The `browsercookie` library simplifies extracting cookies from browsers like Chrome and Firefox by handling encrypted cookie stores.

Other options like JavaScript (Node.js) or shell scripting were considered, but Python strikes the best balance of simplicity and power for this task.

---

### What the Script Does
- **Extracts Cookies**: Pulls cookies from Chrome and Firefox (with the option to add more browsers).
- **Filters by Domain**: Targets cookies for a specific domain (e.g., `.grok.com`), which you can customize.
- **Formats Output**: Prints cookies as a Swift dictionary literal, ready to copy into a Swift project (e.g., for an API client), though you could adapt the output format as needed.
- **Handles Errors**: Gracefully manages cases where a browser isn’t installed or no cookies are found.

### The Script

Here’s the complete Python script:

```python
import json
import browsercookie

def extract_cookies(domain=".grok.com"):
    """
    Extracts cookies for the specified domain from available browsers.
    
    :param domain: The domain to filter cookies for (default: .grok.com)
    :return: A dictionary of cookie name-value pairs
    """
    cookies = {}
    
    # Try Chrome first
    try:
        chrome_cookies = browsercookie.chrome()
        cookies.update({cookie.name: cookie.value for cookie in chrome_cookies if domain in cookie.domain})
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Could not extract cookies from Chrome: {e}")
    
    # If no cookies from Chrome, try Firefox
    if not cookies:
        try:
            firefox_cookies = browsercookie.firefox()
            cookies.update({cookie.name: cookie.value for cookie in firefox_cookies if domain in cookie.domain})
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Could not extract cookies from Firefox: {e}")
    
    return cookies

def print_swift_dict(cookies):
    """
    Prints cookies in a Swift dictionary literal format.
    
    :param cookies: Dictionary of cookie name-value pairs
    """
    if not cookies:
        print("No cookies found for the specified domain.")
        return
    
    swift_dict = "[\n"
    for name, value in cookies.items():
        swift_dict += f'    "{name}": "{value}",\n'
    swift_dict = swift_dict.rstrip(",\n") + "\n]"
    print("Swift Dictionary Literal for Cookies:")
    print(swift_dict)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Extracting cookies...")
    extracted_cookies = extract_cookies()
    print_swift_dict(extracted_cookies)
```

### How to Use It

#### 1. Install Prerequisites
- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if needed.
- **browsercookie Library**: Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install browsercookie
  ```

#### 2. Save the Script
- Copy the script into a file named `extract_cookies.py`.

#### 3. Run the Script
- Open a terminal, navigate to the script’s directory, and run:
  ```bash
  python extract_cookies.py
  ```

#### 4. Example Output
If cookies exist for `.grok.com`, you’ll see something like:
```
Extracting cookies...
Swift Dictionary Literal for Cookies:
[
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "user_token": "xyz789"
]
```
If no cookies are found, it’ll say:
```
Extracting cookies...
No cookies found for the specified domain.
```

#### 5. Customize (Optional)
- **Change the Domain**: Edit the `domain` parameter in `extract_cookies()` (e.g., `domain=".example.com"`).
- **Add More Browsers**: Uncomment and adapt the Safari section (or add others) in the script if needed.

---

### How It Works
- **Cookie Extraction**: The `browsercookie` library accesses browser cookie stores (e.g., SQLite databases for Chrome/Firefox) and decrypts them where necessary.
- **Domain Filtering**: It only keeps cookies matching the specified domain (e.g., `.grok.com`).
- **Output Formatting**: The `print_swift_dict` function formats cookies as a Swift dictionary, but you could modify it to output JSON or another format if preferred.

---

### Security Notes
- **Sensitive Data**: Cookies often contain session tokens or other sensitive info. This script only prints them (no saving to files), but handle the output carefully.
- **Permissions**: The script needs access to browser data, so run it on a trusted system.

### Why This Solution?
This script is simple, reusable, and integrates easily with projects needing browser cookies (e.g., API clients). It’s also extensible—add support for more browsers or tweak the output format as your needs evolve. Let me know if you’d like adjustments or a different approach!
